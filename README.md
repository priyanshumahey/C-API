# C#-API



This is a very simple example of what an API looks like in C#. This uses the Model Views Controller architectural pattern to return "Hello World" to the user. It can easily be configured to obtain other informaiton as it uses a repository holding all the information. Currently uses a mock repository but can easily be changed to an actual SQL database.
